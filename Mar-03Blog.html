   individual contributions, we kept busy for sure. We had set a goal to get a proof of concept prototype done of the final battle and implement mobile functionality (and controller support mostly), using Jira to divide tasks the first things finished came from Troy in his Android implementation which used a free Unity Store asset pack for an on touch analog for left and right stick in the Final Battle Twin Stick Shooter mini game with a home made button as a UI canvas element would serve as the interact button in the HubWorld.
   above first on the left is Val confirming mobile support testing the game on her Ipad(not a target platform at this time but, is a mobile device for testing) and as always Val was our art department cranking out sprites for power ups, animations for the minions and Isarr and took head of the health bar encorporation for the Final Battle pictured below. On the right is my Echo protesting that I spend more time paying attention to my computer than to her.

   I had met regularly with the team as they had worked and provided feedback and help, mostly in the form of eyes and Unity navigation, for Vals asset creation I'm mostly another pair of eyes to provide opinions and input while Troys hunt for mobile support was a quick one we all enjoyed helping Troy through Unity's keyframe animation system for adding a floating effect to the power ups and making them slightly different. I didn't work with Troy when he worked on the powerup and pickup scripts but he did a great job making everything scalable and explained its functionality well.
   I never sat in with Mark and Sean while they worked on the AI which in hindsight as I worked on the Final Battle's Game Manager I would have benefitted from knowing how the enemy AI were being implemented and used. Mark had created the Isarr class and utilized it to maintain a distance which is an adjustable in the inspector variable, Sean had handled the minions AI by using the A* Pathfinding project from arongranberg.com/astar to handle the minions targeting, pathfinding and movement.
   For the Game Manager for the Final Battle I referenced our previous twin stick shooter project, BobbleHead Wars <a href="projects.html">(Projects)</a> from Game Engines 2, the picture below shows a code sample for the spawning logic of the minions and some comments of functionality that could be handled in code but currently isn't and I also included the inspector view for the values that we can adjust as needed after more playtesting and polishing.

   A productive week and going into the reading break I have plans to get the hubworld fully outlined so Val can have an idea of what environment tiles are still needed and to get started on some of the assets and fire class for the Fire Fighter target shooter mini game while Troy is taking the audio for Fire Fighter and Mark, Sean and Val are focusing on components of the Restaruant Rush simon says mini game.
