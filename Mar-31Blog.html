    <p>&emsp;&emsp; March-31,2022: Ninth entry for Project Retribution, relieved of my pixel art struggles The Soaking Spirits mini game (FireFighter was it's placeholder) is moving along well <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
      despite the onsetting burnout and anxieties that come with the end of the project (in regards to the LevelUp showcase) and realizing that the sole start of a section of the game was left until the final week of development. My learning experiences from this last leg has been that I'm no pixel artist yet and I'm grateful to have an artist on the team and that even with the best communication a task can still be left untouched for far too long in a project. <br>
      I've begun commenting through the UI and Game Managers as well as what tasks in the Fire class that I'm struggling with and plan to merge it to main with the team Friday morning to hopefully divide what I haven't finished among us over the weekend.
      The in game work done was the linking of the background to it's UI element and positioning the fire spawn points appropriately in the windows for the fire prefabs to appear, due to a lot of lost time in switching back and forth between UI elements and buttons vs GameObjects with RayCast collision I wound up with 2 different spawning methods that both work but, neither work to interact with the fires, as of yet. <br>
      Shown below are the Fire and Water ball animations Val whipped up for the game and a short video of me showing the fire spawning logic working and the fire animations working on button objects that the team requested.
      I'm still looking forward to railing out this last mini game and making a game I'm happy with for Level Up and adding the polish and final touches for the end of semester launch on google.

  The team was focused independently this past week with Val reaching the end of art tasks and now working out NPC details throughout the world, Mark added polish to memory match and the hub world, Sean continues on with the pause menu implementation and, Troy, the sound man extrodanaire, added a lot of awesome polish to the final battle.
