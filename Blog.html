  <p>&emsp;&emsp; Feb-10,2022: Fourth entry for Project Retribution, the full force of Team Bulbasaur spent this past week tackling our proof-of-concept Prototype containing a mock up of the initial town, npc's and <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">

   the Blazin' Pots Memory Match minigame. On Jira we had divided the work to based on key objectives to make a prototype inline with our final goal, the top image being what our initial idea of what our prototype would be (image by Val) and the bottom shows the final product of the prototype incorporating a combination of suggestions stemming from a passing comment. The tasks divided included me laying out the town on a tile map with help from Val making tiles and helping fine tune colliders. I joined Val and Mark while they were working on the dialog system and start of the Memory Match coding and provided input as needed and helped fill out dialog options with the team.
   Troy was a trooper and managed the Audio Manager and adding sounds with little help, we had met as a team during fine tunings where he walked us through the manager and how to adjust individual values, like the footsteps, bg music and game sounds in memory match. Sean had taken on the HUD and Instructions for the mini game which due to small miscommunication became a team effort that everyone put a hand on, and it came together nicely. 
   As a wrap up to the week we had met with the Snowed In mentors today and show cased the prototype to them and got some feedback and suggestions especially about proofing for android, save states and capsulating the town layouts to duplicate for future towns. It's nice to see the interest from the mentors and seeing the project coming together is a motivator that I think is working well for me and the whole team.

    finishing up our Technical Design Documents. We started the week off Thursday doing final checks over the GDD and translating it for the presentation to the Snowed In mentors, Josh Campbell, Tim Sandwell, Nathan Pringle and Eric Dalrymple who we met with Friday morning and introduced to the team and project thus far.
    The mentors all expressed interest in the project and had some helpful immediate feedback and questions which did help fine tune some of the vaguer details from the GDD for the TDD's and shape an idea for where to focus for the prototype build after.
    On the note of TDD's and minute changes, we've gone from a side-to-side player throws ball at fire to a move and click to interact grid target game for the Fire Fighter minigame with different stages of fires, for thematic and feasibility reasons this makes sense, stretch goal of having a nice water throw and fire animation still.
    Otherwise, all the TDD's stayed fairly the same as planned, things may scale up or down, but we weren't planning to make a FF entry, we don't really have the resources for that.
    Shown on the left are the tile sets made by Val for the prototype and the map I made with the teams feedback for the prototype, I will be taking on the task of populating our hub world with npc's and the level design elements for the prototype.

    the Game Design Document, planning our meeting with our mentors from Snowed In Studios and starting plans for our Technical Design Documents. The planning and work assignment has been done on Jira with the design documents being worked on together using Confluence. The first image on the left is from the presentation we've prepared to introduce Project Retribution to our mentor,
     I chose this slide from the presentation as it is the slide for the mini game that I proposed and is the TDD I will be working on this coming week. The idea of this mini game is to have the player moving side to side while throwing water ball magic at flames burning on a building.
     As a team we had planned out our character, island, and town names along with having me come up with a concept for the island design shown bottom left that Val had improved upon, shown on the right, for the presentation and improved visual. For the TDD's we split the major tasks between us being: me working on the Fire Fighter mini game, Mark on his Memory Matcher mini game, Sean on the Restaurant Rush mini game, Troy on the Final Battle and Val on the Hub World itself.
     The project is moving through the planning phases well so far, the team is well organized and everyone has been great for helping each other and keeping everything progressing.

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;Jan-27,2022: First entry for the final semesters Capstone project with SLC's Game-Programming course. My group, going by Team Bulbasaur, consists of;<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
    myself, Valeria Rincon, Mark Silva, Troy Dexter, and Sean Legroulx. So far for our project we have began establishing team relations, regular meetings, and work distribution preferences. I have opted to focus on Level Design as it's a component to game development that fascinates me and have been offering my opinions along with Sean directly to Val, who has taken the lead for the game's art and has been doing a great job bringing ideas to images thanks to her artistic skills.
    Mark has elected to focus on the User Interface and menu systems we will use in game and has proposed the idea of having social media links, which while ambitious is something I hope we try. Sean, Troy, and I have began planning the mini games that will be a part of the challenges players will overcome in our game. As a team we have been working through our design document, shaping our ideas into a game and I look forward to updating this blog as this project comes together.
