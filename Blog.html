    the Game Design Document, planning our meeting with our mentors from Snowed In Studios and starting plans for our Technical Design Documents. The planning and work assignment has been done on Jira with the design documents being worked on together using Confluence. The first image on the left is from the presentation we've prepared to introduce Project Retribution to our mentor,
     I chose this slide from the presentation as it is the slide for the mini game that I proposed and is the TDD I will be working on this coming week. The idea of this mini game is to have the player moving side to side while throwing water ball magic at flames burning on a building.
     As a team we had planned out our character, island, and town names along with having me come up with a concept for the island design shown bottom left that Val had improved upon, shown on the right, for the presentation and improved visual. For the TDD's we split the major tasks between us being: me working on the Fire Fighter mini game, Mark on his Memory Matcher mini game, Sean on the Restaurant Rush mini game, Troy on the Final Battle and Val on the Hub World itself.
     The project is moving through the planning phases well so far, the team is well organized and everyone has been great for helping each other and keeping everything progressing.

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;Jan-27,2022: First entry for the final semesters Capstone project with SLC's Game-Programming course. My group, going by Team Bulbasaur, consists of;<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
    myself, Valeria Rincon, Mark Silva, Troy Dexter, and Sean Legroulx. So far for our project we have began establishing team relations, regular meetings, and work distribution preferences. I have opted to focus on Level Design as it's a component to game development that fascinates me and have been offering my opinions along with Sean directly to Val, who has taken the lead for the game's art and has been doing a great job bringing ideas to images thanks to her artistic skills.
    Mark has elected to focus on the User Interface and menu systems we will use in game and has proposed the idea of having social media links, which while ambitious is something I hope we try. Sean, Troy, and I have began planning the mini games that will be a part of the challenges players will overcome in our game. As a team we have been working through our design document, shaping our ideas into a game and I look forward to updating this blog as this project comes together.

<p>Just a test this week so I'll comment this out whether it works or not.(somewhere around 50 or so characters then hit the ->) <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
    but this is where I'll put some game reviews and objective opinions of games as they come out but I'm mostly testing where the read mores fall.
