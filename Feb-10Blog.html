    finishing up our Technical Design Documents. We started the week off Thursday doing final checks over the GDD and translating it for the presentation to the Snowed In mentors, Josh Campbell, Tim Sandwell, Nathan Pringle and Eric Dalrymple who we met with Friday morning and introduced to the team and project thus far.
    The mentors all expressed interest in the project and had some helpful immediate feedback and questions which did help fine tune some of the vaguer details from the GDD for the TDD's and shape an idea for where to focus for the prototype build after.
    On the note of TDD's and minute changes, we've gone from a side-to-side player throws ball at fire to a move and click to interact grid target game for the Fire Fighter minigame with different stages of fires, for thematic and feasibility reasons this makes sense, stretch goal of having a nice water throw and fire animation still.
    Otherwise, all the TDD's stayed fairly the same as planned, things may scale up or down, but we weren't planning to make a FF entry, we don't really have the resources for that.
    Shown on the left are the tile sets made by Val for the prototype and the map I made with the teams feedback for the prototype, I will be taking on the task of populating our hub world with npc's and the level design elements for the prototype.
