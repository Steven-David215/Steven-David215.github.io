    the Game Design Document, planning our meeting with our mentors from Snowed In Studios and starting plans for our Technical Design Documents. The planning and work assignment has been done on Jira with the design documents being worked on together using Confluence. The first image on the left is from the presentation we've prepared to introduce Project Retribution to our mentor,
     I chose this slide from the presentation as it is the slide for the mini game that I proposed and is the TDD I will be working on this coming week. The idea of this mini game is to have the player moving side to side while throwing water ball magic at flames burning on a building.
     As a team we had planned out our character, island, and town names along with having me come up with a concept for the island design shown bottom left that Val had improved upon, shown on the right, for the presentation and improved visual. For the TDD's we split the major tasks between us being: me working on the Fire Fighter mini game, Mark on his Memory Matcher mini game, Sean on the Restaurant Rush mini game, Troy on the Final Battle and Val on the Hub World itself.
     The project is moving through the planning phases well so far, the team is well organized and everyone has been great for helping each other and keeping everything progressing.
